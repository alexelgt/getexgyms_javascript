# **How to get GeoJSON files**
To get each file you'll have to run a specific query in the website overpass-turbo.eu. In the folder _overpass-turbo_queries_ of this repo there are 2 txt files with the queries for EX and exclusion areas but you can also use the following links:

## **EX areas query**
Query: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/N3E

Run the query and then download (export) as a GeoJSON file.

*Note: this is a modified version of the query found in reference 3 (by reddit user /u/Tntnnbltn).*

## **Exclusion areas query**
Query: https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/N3G

Run the query and then download (export) as a GeoJSON file.

*Note: this is a modified version of the query found in reference 4 (by reddit user /u/Tntnnbltn).*

*Note 2: if you check reference 5, in that post from reddit user u/NicoisLost it's included a query that happens to be the same as mine. I came across that reddit post after doing this project (while checking for references that might help anyone). In any case I think is worth mentioning him and the work he has done.*
