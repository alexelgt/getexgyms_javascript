                  With this website you'll be able to identify which gyms should have the <i>EX raid gym</i> tag and which gyms don't have the tag due to being inside an exclusion area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If one of the gyms is classified as an EX gym but does not have the tag in the game is might be due to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>There is something we don't know that makes the gym not being EX.</li>
                  <li>Gyms that come from POIs created after a given date (it should be between 20th July 2018 and 19th August 2018 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/akcel3/the_death_of_new_ex_raid_eligible_gyms_changes_to/" target="_blank">according to u/Tntnnbltn</a>) and became a gym before October 22, 2019 are still not able to get the EX Raid tag.</li>
                  <li>The POI was added to Pokémon GO on a correct date but there's not been a wave to give it the tag. It seems that there is a wave on the 25th of every month.</li>

                  The website has some modes being the 2 most important Manual and Automatic. You need to include a list with all the gyms you want to check no matter which mode is used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The file (.txt or .csv) with all the gyms has to be in the format <b>Name,Latitude,Longitude</b>. Here is an example of the content of a valid txt file:

                <p>
                  In some cases a difference of a few meters matter so it's very important to use the exact coordinates of the gyms so here are some ways to obtain them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Intel Ingress Map (requires an Ingress account)</b>
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Go to <a href="https://intel.ingress.com" target="_blank">https://intel.ingress.com</a> and log in.</li>
                  <li>Make sure you are on desktop (Full mode).</li>
                  <li>Click on the portal you want to obtain the coordinates.</li>
                  <li>Click on link and copy the link.</li>
                  <li>The coordinates of the portal are the ones after "&pll=" (the ones at the end of the link).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <b>Pokémon GO</b>
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Tap the gym and then tap 2 times in the arrow that's on the the top right.</li>
                  <li>Tap the button with the text "VIEW IN MAP" (the text will be different depending on the language of your device).</li>
                  <li>Check instructions for Google Maps or Apple Maps.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <b>Google Maps</b>
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Tap on the card that appeared at the bottom.</li>
                  <li>Scroll down until you find the coordinates.</li>
                  <li>Long press them and they will be copied to your clipboard.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  <b>Apple Maps</b>
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Tap the share button and copy the link. The link is a "little" messy but the coordinates are after "%ll=".</li>
                </ul>

              </div>

              <h3 class="STRING_MODES_TITLE">Modes</h3>
              <h4 class="STRING_AUTOMATIC_MODE_TITLE">Automatic mode</h4>
              <div id="text_block" class="info STRING_AUTOMATIC_MODE_TEXT">
                <p>
                  This mode uses the Overpass API to get EX and exclusions area in the area covered by the gyms. The Overpass API is a little restrictive so the website has some limitations to avoid errors with the API. As this mode uses the Overpass API, it's much slower than manual mode (although obtaining both GeoJSON also takes some time).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you have included a file with all the gyms, do the following steps:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Click the button <i>EX areas</i> and wait until the website says EX areas loaded correctly.</li>
                  <li>Wait 50 seconds, then click the button <i>Exclusion areas</i> and wait until the website says Exclusion areas loaded correctly.</li>
                  <li>Click the button Get EX and blocked gyms.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4 class="STRING_MANUAL_MODE_TITLE">Manual mode</h4>
              <div id="text_block" class="info STRING_MANUAL_MODE_TEXT">
                <p>
                  In this mode GeoJSON files of EX and exclusion areas have to be included.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to obtain these files, you have to use overpass-turbo with some given queries. Click on the links below, center the map in the area you want to include, run the query and export the results as a GeoJSON file.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you have the files, upload then and click the button <i>Get EX and blocked gyms</i>.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h4 class="STRING_URL_MODE_TITLE">URL mode</h4>
              <div id="text_block" class="info STRING_URL_MODE_TEXT">
                <p>
                  It's similar to manual mode but files for EX and exclusion areas are given as URLs. This mode is useful if you upload the GeoJSON files to an external server.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>
                  After you've clicked the button <i>Get EX and blocked gyms</i>, a button will appear to download a csv including all the EX gyms and those that are in an exclusion area. You'll also be given a summary of the results.

                  If you get at least one blocked gym (EX gym inside an exclusion area), a button called <i>Get kml file with blocked gyms</i> will appear. If you click it, a kml file will be automatically downloaded. This file can be uploaded to Google My Maps to see the exclusion areas that block the gyms to be EX.
